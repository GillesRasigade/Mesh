All methods have been developed and tested for now on an Linux Ubuntu and might work as the same any Unix system.\r\n\r\nThe user interface is developed in HTML5, Javascript and CSS. No additional language is used here. As HTML5 specifications are not samely integrated in all browsers, some differences may appear.\r\n\r\n# Getting started\r\n\r\n## Get the source\r\n\r\nFetch the source code in a proper folder on your media server:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/billou-fr/media-manager.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Prepare your system\r\n\r\nCreate symbolic link in the default Apache2 folder (or simply use your own Virtualhost !):\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo ln -s ./web /var/www/media-server\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate directories used by the application and manage permissions:\r\n\r\n- Main directory where all media files are located:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir /usr/local/media-server\r\nchown -R www-data: /usr/local/media-server\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Directory used to store the application data:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir /etc/media-server\r\nchown -R www-data: /etc/media-server\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Log file directory:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmkdir /var/log/media-server;\r\nchown -R www-data: /var/log/media-server\r\n\r\ntouch /var/log/media-server/application.log\r\nchown -R www-data: /var/log/media-server/application.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Create and update the application configuration file:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ncd ./app/config\r\ncp config.ini.template config.ini\r\nnano config.ini\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Test it !\r\n\r\nLoad the following address in your browser:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nhttp://localhost/mesh\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will be redirected to the login page and if you did not update the users' section in the configuration file yet, you can use the following information :\r\n```bash\r\nlogin: admin\r\npassword: ***\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
