Media Manager
=============

The Media Manager project aims to break the borders between servers, desktop computers and mobiles devices such as a tablet or a smartphone.

Media Manager is composed of 2 main parts : a webservice (WS) and a user interface (UI).

The web service exposes an API accessed asynchronously y the UI. All methods have been developed and tested for now on an Linux Ubuntu and might work as the same any Unix system.

The user interface is developed in HTML5, Javascript and CSS. No additional language is used here. As HTML5 specifications are not samely integrated in all browsers, some differences may appear.
